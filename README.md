smallcalc
=========

A small command-line calculator: 

<b>smallcalc</b> is a simple recursive descent parser written in C/C++, to familiarize myself with basic parsing techniques. 
My implementation is mainly inspired by minic, a parser that implements a small subset of the C language that was published 
at the appendix of the book "The Art of C++" written by Herbert Schildt.
