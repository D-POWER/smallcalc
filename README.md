smallcalc
=========

A small command-line calculator: 

<b>smallcalc</b> is a simple recursive descent parser written in C/C++ to familiarize myself with basic parsing techniques. 
My implementation is mainly inspired by minic, a small parser, that implements a subset of the C language, which was published 
at the appendix of the book "The Art of C++" written by Herbert Schildt.
